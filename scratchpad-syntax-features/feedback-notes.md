- implement classic algos
- consider the use of computed indices for lists with $list-name.($index + 1)
- implement classic recursion tests

    -  modulo should be "remainder" and be available  as both an operator and a function? (function?) or also %. % fits more with the established pattern of using symbols for mathematical operators but remainder is more self apparent.
- squaring operators?
- inverse exponent (the root)
