Currently have @() for passing anon functions as references, but the one remaining need for that is when passing an anon function reference as an argument to a function param. If function params were a "storage" context then that would eliminate the need for @() all together. Furthermore if we just made all contexts "storage" contexts except for !() then that simplifies the mental model by quite a bit (though it would run counter to the typical way things are done and would basically move Enzo closer to Haskell's lazy eval way of doing things.) It could even make it so that invoking a function required a bang with !function-name() to invoke and function-name() just being the function body.
