- implement classic algos
- named rebinding for function arguments
- forbid concatenation of text, create error test cases
- Loop from 1 to 10, ($i; ...);
- ability to loop over just keys or just unnamed indexes
- `maybe` pipeline operator or try/catch stuff
- block quotes
- multiline text
- text escape characters
- Blueprints that have type but no default set, and then you create an instance without specifying the value. Should be an error.
- instancing a blueprint with the wrong type for a field.
- arithmetic operations that mix types (like `"5" + 5`). Should error
- divide by zero errors
- floating point math
- destructuring blueprint instances (instances are like lists but we haven't actually shown any destructuring of a blueprint instance)
- blueprint extension with inheritance
- builtin functions
- casting solutions?
- is odd/even conditional?
- squaring operators?
- inverse exponent?
- generics?
