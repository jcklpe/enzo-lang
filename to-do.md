- if I should ever come back to this branch, to finish it, I would need to finish getting all the existing test cases working. They have most been converted over to the next syntax but double checking would be needed, and then I'd need to actually implement it, get them passing etc.

- implement classic algos
- builtin functions
- casting solutions?
- is odd/even conditional?
- squaring operators?
- inverse exponent?
